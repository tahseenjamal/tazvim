## About

Having used VIM for a long time, I wanted to maintain a familiar feel while transitioning to a new editor. To achieve this, I created a straightforward NeoVim setup thatâ€™s ideal for both newcomers to NeoVim and those switching from VIM. This minimal configuration includes only the essential plugins, ensuring a smooth and efficient coding experience without unnecessary complexity.
